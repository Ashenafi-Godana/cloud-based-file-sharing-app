# cloud-based-file-sharing-app

A cloud based file-sharing application using the Google Drive API. Users can upload files to Google drive through the application and share them with others. Authenticate users, upload files, and manage permissions using cloud-based APIs.

### Let's break it down

1. User authentication

- The application redirects the user to Google's authentication server, where they can log in using their Google account credentials.
- Once the user logs in, Google generates an access token and redirects the user back to the application with the access token.
- The application can then use this access token to make authorized API requests on behalf of the user.

2. File Upload

- First the user needs to be authenticated (as explained above) to obtain an access token that allows the application to make API requests on behalf of the user.
- Once authenticated, the application can use the appropriate API method (e.g., files.create in the case of Google Drive API) to upload files.
- When uploading files, you need to specify the file metadata (e.g., file name, MIME type) and the file content (binary data).
- After successfully uploading the file, the cloud storage service returns a unique identifier (e.g., file ID) that the application can use to manage the uploaded file (e.g., share, delete).

3. Manage Permissions

- You need to authenticate as the owner of the file/folder or have sufficient permissions to manage permissions.
- Use the appropriate API method (e.g., permissions.create in the case of Google Drive API) to set permissions for the file/folder.
- Specify the type of permission (e.g., read-only, read-write), the user or group to grant permissions to (e.g., email address), and any additional settings (e.g., whether to send notification emails).
- After setting permissions, the specified users or groups will have the appropriate level of access to the file/folder according to the permissions you've configured.

In summary, to authenticate users, upload files, and manage permissions using cloud-based APIs, you'll need to implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication, use API methods provided by the cloud storage service to upload files, and manage permissions as needed to control access to files and folders.
